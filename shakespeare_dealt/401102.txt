my love is strengthen d though more weak in seem i love not less though less the show appear that love is merchand whose rich esteem the owner s tongu doth publish everi where our love wa new and then but in the spring when i wa wont to greet it with my lay as philomel in summer s front doth sing and stop her pipe in growth of riper day not that the summer is less pleasant now than when her mourn hymn did hush the night but that wild music burthen everi bough and sweet grown common lose their dear delight therefor like her i sometim hold my tongu becaus i would not dull you with my song
