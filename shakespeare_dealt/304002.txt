one of these coronet and as i told you he put it by onc but for all that to my think he would fain have had it then he offer it to him again then he put it by again but to my think he wa veri loath to lay hi finger off it and then he offer it the third time he put it the third time by and still as he refus it the rabblement hoot and clap their chap hand and threw up their sweati night cap and utter such a deal of stink breath becaus caesar refus the crown that it had almost choke caesar for he swound and fell down at it and for mine own part i durst not laugh for fear of open my lip and receiv the bad air cassiu but soft i pray you what did caesar swound casca he fell down in the market place and foam at mouth and wa speechless brutu ti veri like he hath the fail sick cassiu no caesar hath it not but you and i and honest casca we have the fall sick casca i know not what you mean by that but i am sure caesar fell down if the tag rag peopl did not clap him and hiss him accord as he pleas and displeas them as they use to do the player in the theatr i am no true man brutu what said he when he came unto himself casca marri befor he fell down when he perceiv the common herd wa glad he refus the crown he pluck me ope hi doublet and offer them hi throat to cut an i had been a man of ani occup if i would not have taken him at a word i would i might go to hell among the rogu and so he fell when he came to himself again he said if he had done or said ani thing amiss he desir their worship to think it wa hi infirm three or four wench where i stood cri ala good soul and forgav him with all their heart but there s no heed to be taken of them if caesar had stab their mother they would have done no less brutu and after that he came thu sad away casca ay cassiu did cicero say ani thing casca ay he spoke greek cassiu to what effect casca nay an i tell you that ill ne er look you i the face again but those that understood him smile at one anoth and shook their head but for mine
