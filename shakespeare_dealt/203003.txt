mortal under thi conjur speak my lord for we will hear note and believ in heart that what you speak is in your conscienc wash d as pure as sin with baptism canterburi then hear me graciou sovereign and you peer that owe yourselv your live and servic to thi imperi throne there is no bar to make against your high claim to franc but thi which they produc from pharamond in terram salicam mulier ne succed no woman shall succeed in saliqu land which saliqu land the french unjustli gloze to be the realm of franc and pharamond the founder of thi law and femal bar yet their own author faith affirm that the land saliqu is in germani between the flood of sala and of elb where charl the great have subdu the saxon there left behind and settl certain french who hold in disdain the german women for some dishonest manner of their life establish d then thi law to wit no femal should be inheritrix in saliqu land which saliqu as i said twixt elb and sala is at thi day in germani call d meisen then
